# Suguru (Tectonic)

To challenge myself I developed a simple sudoko-like game on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Click or tap the squares to be able to fill in a number. The number cannot exceed the number of squares of that perticular colour. Also like regular sudoku, you cannot have the same number in adjacent squares. Click or tap 'Check' to verify your solution. There are multiple difficulties.

I didn't come up with the concept or the game rules but I wanted to create an attractive version of this game that would work well on mobile devices. This was developed using React and uses (s)css for it's graphics and animations.

Uses react, typescript and mainly scss for it's visuals
